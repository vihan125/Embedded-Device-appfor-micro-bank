# MICRO BANK APP

## Project description
This is a mobile interface developed using flutter and also an embedded database developed using dart and sqlite libraries. 
The mobile devices contains only lightweight databases and can only handle deposit and
withdraw functionalities. To make the transactions efficient and less costly, mobile device
update the central server only after a particular number of transactions, as a batch processing
or after a certain time period depending on which comes first. An account holder is only allowed
to withdraw money from one mobile banking agent to avoid withdrawing money more than he
actually has deposited. However any account holder can make a special request and get the
facility to withdraw money from any mobile agent with a additional service cost per each
transaction. These type of withdrawal transactions are called critical transactions and they
immediately update the central server. These mobile agents provide service to joint account
holders as well and those accounts are given the multiple agent withdrawal facility by default.
